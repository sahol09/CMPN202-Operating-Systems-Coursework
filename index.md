## Welcome

This repository contains my **weekly coursework journal** for the Operating Systems module.

The purpose of this journal is to document, step by step, the practical work carried out across the semester.  
Each week focuses on a specific topic such as system planning, security configuration, performance testing, monitoring, and final system hardening.

All work has been completed using a Linux-based virtualised environment consisting of **Ubuntu Desktop (workstation)** and **Ubuntu Server (server)** communicating over a private network.  
The work is supported with:

- Command-line outputs  
- Configuration files  
- Screenshots as evidence  
- Structured explanations  
- Weekly reflections

## Assessment Mapping (How this journal meets the brief)

This journal is structured across Week 1 to Week 7, matching the coursework phases:

- **Week 1:** System planning, OS comparison, architecture design, network plan, and CLI specification evidence  
- **Week 2:** Security baseline planning, threat model, and testing methodology  
- **Week 3:** Workload and application selection with monitoring strategy  
- **Week 4:** SSH hardening (key-based authentication), firewall restriction, and user privilege management  
- **Week 5:** AppArmor enforcement, automatic security updates, fail2ban configuration, and required automation scripts  
- **Week 6:** Performance testing with data tables and graphs, bottleneck analysis, and optimisation (before/after)  
- **Week 7:** Security audit (Lynis and nmap), service audit, remediation evidence, and remaining risk assessment  

All system administration and configuration tasks were performed remotely using **SSH from the workstation to the server**, reflecting real-world system administration practice.

## Final Note

This journal demonstrates my understanding of operating system concepts through hands-on configuration, testing, evaluation, and critical reflection.  
All technical decisions made throughout the coursework are justified with respect to **security, performance, stability, and best practice**.
